This is a proof of concept for a language independent parser. It is able to handle any concatenative morphology (including circumfixation), but it is unable to handle reduplication.
Infixation and triconsonental root systems can be handled, albeit very inefficiently and not naturalistically. I would like to return to this in the future.
It is unlikely that NDFSTs will be able to handle replication well. If I ever try to handle those, I will use bidirectional finite state automata.

Either way check out the PDF for more information on its motivation, how it works, and to run a few examples!
